# Biography

Currently, social media is an inseparable part of people's lives, particularly those living in urban areas. On the one hand, several negative issues follow social media view, such as hoaxes and hate speech. But on the other hand, social media can also be a point where we can identify an authentic public opinion, a media to organise movements, and so forth. It is for me, as a master student of management and public policy interested in research that utilises data from social media. For that reason, I focus on studying the intersection of information technology and public policy, also inquire ways to use soft data in the policy-making processes.
